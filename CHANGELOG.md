# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [0.3] - 2026-03-28
### Added
- **Complete Backend Delivery Management System**
    - Created all 11 entities based on ERD (User, Sender, Rider, Admin, Parcel, Delivery, Vehicle, TrackingHistory, Payment, File, RefreshToken)
    - Created corresponding repositories for all entities
    - Established proper JPA relationships (OneToOne, OneToMany, ManyToOne)

- **Delivery Service & Controller**
    - Created DeliveryService with business logic:
        - Create delivery with auto-generated tracking number
        - Accept delivery by rider
        - Update delivery status with location tracking
        - Cancel delivery
        - Get tracking history
    - Implemented DeliveryController with REST endpoints
    - Added automatic tracking history recording on every status change

### API Endpoints Added
- `POST /api/deliveries` - Create new delivery request
- `GET /api/deliveries/available` - Get available deliveries for riders
- `GET /api/deliveries/my` - Get current user's deliveries
- `PUT /api/deliveries/{id}/accept` - Accept delivery (rider only)
- `PUT /api/deliveries/{id}/status` - Update delivery status with location
- `GET /api/deliveries/{id}/track` - Get full tracking history
- `PUT /api/deliveries/{id}/cancel` - Cancel delivery

### Technical Improvements
- Tracking number format: `QP-timestamp` (e.g., QP-1743161234567)
- Status workflow: PENDING → ACCEPTED → PICKED_UP → IN_TRANSIT → DELIVERED → CANCELLED
- Automatic timestamp recording for pickup and delivery events
- Location tracking for each status update
